    <p><a href="http://instdav.ics.uci.edu/~191grp10/AnteaterNetwork-Testing/">Anteater Network</a> is a new, clean, and expandable system created by <a href="#jmmp">JMMP</a> for the <a href="http://alumni.uci.edu/">University of California, Irvine Alumni Association</a> as my senior design project for the informatics undergraduate program.</p>
    <p>The system helps connect current and past students and faculty to other alumni who have started their own businesses. By displaying these businesses on a map and offering a variety of filters the Anteater Network offers a highly effective, convenient, and visual representation of the spread of UCI's alumni network.</p>
